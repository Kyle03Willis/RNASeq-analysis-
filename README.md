# RNASeq-analysis-
Code in R that will allow for the analysis of RNASeq analysis. I plan to write the code in a way that allows for fast analysis of new datasets. 

The first attempt at writing this code will utilise data from the paper titled: 'Hypoxia-mediated translational activation of ITGB3 in breast cancer cells enhances TGF-Î² signaling and malignant features in vitro and in vivo'.

The data is avalible at: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE104193. NCBIU: GEO.
